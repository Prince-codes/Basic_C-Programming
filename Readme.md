- **`check_even-odd.c`**: Determines if a number is even or odd.
- **`check_grade2.c`**: Displays grades based on marks entered by the user.
- **`check_smallest-in-3.c`**: Finds the smallest of three numbers.
- **`marks_total-avg-grd.c`**: Calculates total and average marks and assigns a grade.
- **`reversing_no.c`**: Reverses a given number.
- **`average.c`**: Calculates the average of three numbers.
- **`fibonacci.c`**: Prints the Fibonacci series up to a given number.
- **`factorial.c`**: Calculates the factorial of a given number.
- **`swap_numbers.c`**: Swaps two numbers using a temporary variable.
- **`prime_check.c`**: Checks if a number is prime.

> **Note**: There are more general programs in this repository that are not listed here, such as experimental or utility programs.

### Loop Programs
- **`all_loop.c`**: Demonstrates `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
- **`for_loop.c`**: Prints numbers from 1 to 100 using a `for` loop.

### Array Programs
- **`array_input.c`**: Demonstrates input and manipulation of arrays.
- **`array_reverse.c`**: Reverses the elements of an array.
- **`array-multiplication-5.c`**: Stores the multiplication table of 5 in an array.
- **`array-pointer.c`**: Demonstrates the use of pointers with arrays.

### File I/O Programs
- **`fileIO.c`**: Demonstrates various file modes (`r`, `w`, `a`) and basic file operations.
- **`fileIO2.c`**: Reads the entire content of a file using a loop.
- **`fileIO3.c`**: Reads three integers from a file.
- **`fileIO4.c`**: Generates a multiplication table and writes it to a file.
- **`fileIO5.c`**: Reads a file character by character and writes its content twice to another file.
- **`fileIO6.c`**: Takes employee details as input and writes them to a file.
- **`fileIO7.c`**: Modifies a file containing an integer by doubling its value.

### Dynamic Memory Allocation
- **`malloc3.c`**: Allocates memory dynamically using `calloc()` and initializes it with default values.
- **`malloc4.c`**: Creates an array of size `n` using `calloc()` based on user input.
- **`malloc5.c`**: Demonstrates resizing a dynamically allocated memory block using `realloc()`.

### Pattern Printing
- **`pattern1.c`**: Prints a right-angled triangle pattern.
- **`pattern2.c`**: Prints a pyramid pattern.
- **`pattern3.c`**: Prints a number pattern.
- **`pattern4.c`**: Prints a pyramid of stars.
- **`pattern5.c`**: Prints a complex number pattern.
- **`pattern6.c`**: Prints a 5x5 grid of asterisks (`*`).
- **`pattern7.c`**: Demonstrates a pattern with conditions.
- **`pattern8.c`**: Prints a pattern of characters from `A` to `E`.

### Projects 
- **`project1.c`**: Implements a specific functionality or project logic (add a brief description of what the project does).
- **`project2.c`**: Implements a simple game logic for player vs. computer.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open any `.c` file in your preferred IDE or text editor.
3. Compile the file using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`) and run the executable.

   Example:
   ```bash
   gcc test.c -o test
   ./test
   ```
